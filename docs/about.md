# About Daign SVG

Daign SVG is a new online SVG editor, still in the early stages.

There surely exist a lot of SVG editors already, but none of the ones I've been working with quite suited my needs. In fact I've written so many SVG graphics by hand until now, it started to really annoy me. Especially when using SVG graphics as a base for dynamic web applications, the SVG outputted by programs like Inkscape needs too much rework before you can combine it with your scripts to manipulate the DOM. Therefore I'm aiming to create a SVG editor that outputs clean XML code and exposes as many options as to how the SVG is formatted as possible to the user.

Besides that I plan to add CAD-like construction aides to enable the creation of precise geometries. Furthermore the user interface should allow to accomplish most tasks by using only the keyboard, encouraging the user to retreat to the mouse only where it's more comfortable.

Yet at the moment I'm still working at the underlying program architecture, before adding the cool stuff.
